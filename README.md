It's made for Moto G54. So, use it for other devices at your own risk.

This script can-

 [1] Flash custom rom using adb sideload

 [2] Flash custom rom using fastboot

 [3] Extract vendor boot

 [4] Extract boot image

 [5] Patch boot image using KSU

 [6] Patch boot image using Magisk

 [7] Flash vendor boot using fastbootd

 [8] Flash boot image using fastbootd

 [9] Flash stock using flashfile.xml

The magisk patching option is currently broken and will be added later.

# Note1: To flash rom using fastboot, place rom zip in the same folder.
