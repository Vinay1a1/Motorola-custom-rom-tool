# flashing-AIO

It can-
 [1] Flash custom rom using adb sideload
 [2] Flash custom rom using fastboot
 [3] Extract vendor boot
 [4] Extract boot image
 [5] Patch boot image using KSU
 [6] Patch boot image using Magisk
 [7] Flash vendor boot using fastbootd
 [8] Flash boot image using fastbootd

The magisk patching option is currently broken and will be added later.

Note: To flash rom using fastboot, place rom zip in the same folder.

The images should be named boot and vendor_boot because I am lazy and hardcoded it.
